# Intoduction to EasyFlow:

`EasyFlow` is a Keras and Tensorflow native implementation that mimics the functionality of SKLearn's Pipeline api, but implemented natively in Tensorflow and Keras. The `EasyFlow` package implements an interface that contains easy feature preprocessing pipelines to build a full training and inference pipeline by only utilizing the Tensorflow and Keras framework. A usecase could be if one needs to migrate an existing SKLearn training and inference pipeline to Tensorlow and Keras. Or if you need to make use of other benefits one can get with Tensorflow; for example Tensorflow serving to serve models.
