## VERSION 1.3.0
* Refactor by implementing best practices from Keras and Tensorflow
* Layer's subclass layer class and implemented new custom layers
    - FeatureInputLayer: Dict of Input layers
    - PreprocessingChainer: Adapt's multiple preprocessing layers
                            (Subclasses Layer)
    - SequentialPreprocessingChainer: Adapt's multiple preprocessing layers
                                      (Subclasses Sequential model)
* Main interface is now subclassing Layer class:
    - BaseFeaturePreprocessorLayer: This class also implements adapt method
* New interfaces:
    - FeaturePreprocessor: Outputs a layer for each step
    - FeaturePreprocessorUnion: Concatenates steps into single layer
* Deprecated previous class Pipeline and FeatureUnion
